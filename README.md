# AI-Powered Developer Tools Research & Analysis
This project automates the discovery, scraping, and analysis of developer tools and software products using AI.  
Given a topic or category, it searches the web for relevant tools, extracts their names, visits their official sites, produces structured and comparable data about each, along with recommendations of when it's best to use it.
